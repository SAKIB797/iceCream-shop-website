# Ice Cream Shop Website
This is my practice project for an e-commerce website of an ice cream shop.  
I developed all the web pages using pure HTML and CSS with a small amount of JavaScript.  
I did not use any frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind.  
I took inspiration for the UI from https://htmlcodex.com/ice-cream-shop-website-template.
