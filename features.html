    <h1>JavaScript features</h1>
    <pre>
    <code>
The code is JavaScript code that is used to handle a form submission with the ID "registrationForm." Here are the features of this code:

1. **Event Listener**:
   - `document.getElementById('registrationForm').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { ... }); `: Attaches an event listener to the form with the ID "registrationForm" for the "submit" event. When the form is submitted, the provided function is executed.

2. **Form Data Extraction**:
   - `const username = document.getElementById('username').value; `: Retrieves the value of the input element with the ID "username."
   - `const password = document.getElementById('password').value; `: Retrieves the value of the input element with the ID "password."
   - `const postcode = document.getElementById('postcode').value; `: Retrieves the value of the input element with the ID "postcode."

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages are collected in the `errorMessages` array.
   - Checks are performed on the form input data, and if any of the conditions fail, an error message is added to the `errorMessages` array.

4. **Error Message Generation**:
   - If the `username` is blank, the message "Username cannot be blank" is added to the `errorMessages` array.
   - If the `password` is less than 9 characters long, the message "Password must be at least 9 characters long" is added to the `errorMessages` array.
   - If the `postcode` does not match the pattern of a 4-digit number, the message "Postcode must be a 4-digit number" is added to the `errorMessages` array.

5. **Form Submission Prevention**:
   - `e.preventDefault(); `: Prevents the form from being submitted if there are errors. This is done by invoking `preventDefault()` on the event object `e`.

6. **Error Message Display**:
   - `const errorMessageDiv = document.getElementById('errorMessages'); `: Retrieves the element with the ID "errorMessages" where error messages will be displayed.
   - `errorMessageDiv.innerHTML = errorMessages.join('br'); `: Updates the content of the "errorMessages" element to display error messages separated by line breaks ("br").

   In summary, this code listens for the form submission, checks the input data for errors (username, password, and postcode), and prevents the form from being submitted if there are errors. It also displays error messages in an element with the ID "errorMessages."
